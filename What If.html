        <h1 class="title">What If</h1>
        <div id="mainDiv">Program: Photoshop. This was the What If prject where we were tasked with creating two token designs based on a prompt and a creative writing project. My creative writing reads: The day the moon blinked.
The mid autumn festival. An event held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar.
This day is usually celebrated with friends and family, viewing the moon at its brightest.
However, on the night of the festival, people watched in horror and confusion as the moon
vanished. Panic spread quickly, but confusion only grew as minutes later the moon returned.
Soon after, all around the world people reported accounts of what the news was calling “moon
blinks”. Sightings of these blinks started to become more frequent as the months went on.
Scientists tried to figure out what was happening, but were coming up with dead end after dead
end. Throughout the process, the astronauts aboard the international space station had been
vital to monitoring the moon and checking for anything that could be approaching the earth.
However, after one of the moon blinks, no country was able to get in touch with any of the
astronauts on board. They were also unable to receive signals from any of their satellites. They
sent satellite after satellite up to assess damages, but all of them were lost with no contact after
5 minutes of exiting the earth’s atmosphere. The scientists had no choice but to send a manned
spacecraft to report what had happened. When the astronaut reached where the space station
should be, it was destroyed. However, they were unable to report these findings af they were
captured by rabbit-like aliens. It turned out that these rabbit aliens were the ones causing the
“moon blinks” to alert their troops of the next planet they sought to “liberate”. Their idea of
liberation was silencing the people of these planets, forcing them to labor for very little, then
draining all of their resources. This was a very fun project and I put a lot of research into the cultural significance behind the mid autumn festival to create my designs. I'd have to say that resarch was orobably the hardest part of this project and I had a lof of fun maknig these designs!</div>
