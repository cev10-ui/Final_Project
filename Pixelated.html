        <div id="mainDiv">Program: Photoshop. This was the pixelated project in which we utilized cropping and resizing tools to create effective pieces with reduced pixel sizes. I did not find this project hard or challenging in any sense. I found it quite fun to expiriment with the reduction of images and creating more abstract images based around cutting a pixelated image. It was a very interesting creative exercise to say the least. If I were to do it again, I believe I would have paid more attention to my settings and the sizing of the photos for the final export. This way, I would have my photos at a proper size and not looking so tiny on this page.</div>
