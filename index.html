        <div id="mainDiv">Intro To Digital Studio Practice, Fall 2025. My approach to digital media this semester was to learn as much as possible and explore several new mediums. In this semester I learned much more than I had expected to, leading to an overall growth as an artist and designer. I have learned what mediums are my bread and butter what other mediums I do not wish to ever have to touch again. I hope ypu can see my progress and journey throughout this portfolio and the projects I have completed.</div>
