        <div id="mainDiv">Program: Photoshop. This was the perfect mask project where using photoshop I created these color masks to place atop this black and white photo. I enjoyed this project greatly with the contrast between the bright colors and black and white compositions. I had previous knowledge on the mask feature, so I didn't find this exercise challenging but I did see it as a very fun refresher exercise. If I were to do this project again maybe I would have used more than one mask layer or some sort of other color or pattern.</div>
